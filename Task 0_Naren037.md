Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network is the analysis of Protein interactions at the cellular level to represent the physical or functional interactions between proteins using mathematical models and graphs. These interactions take place between the binding regions that are present in the proteins, and they are attributed to a specific biological function.

**Topological analysis** - The maximum number of proteins in a network have very minimal interactions whereas only a few key proteins (Hub proteins) contain high interactions, and due to this variation, no single node can be used as a scale to generalize all the other nodes of the network and are hence called “scale-free”(Albert, 2005).

**Modular analysis** - Breakdown of a complex biological network into simpler closely related modules, mainly based on functional similarities (Luo et al., 2007).

**PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION DETECTION:**

**Biophysical methods** - Mass spectrometry, affinity chromatography, co-immunoprecipitation, protein microarrays, protein fragment completion, phage display, X-ray crystallography, and NMR spectroscopy (Rao et al., 2014a).

**High-throughput methods**

● Yeast two-hybrid system - Predicting binding of two target proteins by fusing them with the DNA binding domain and transactivating domain of a transcription factor (Walhout & Vidal, 2001).  

● Co-expression - Genes of proteins involved in an interaction are co-expressed to enable the products’ interaction.

● Synthetic lethality - Introducing mutations in genes that are viable on their own but become lethal when combined - indirect; can predict functional interactions.

**Computational methods -** The generation of valuable experimental data led to the development of several _in silico_ methods for predicting new protein-protein interactions, such as sequence-based approaches, structure-based approaches, chromosome proximity, gene fusion, _in silico_ 2 hybrid, mirror tree, phylogenetic tree, gene ontology, and gene expression-based approaches (Rao et al., 2014). ****

**Protein interaction database** - The predicted protein-protein interaction data are stored in databases such as MINT and STRING (Calderone et al., 2020; Szklarczyk et al., 2023)

**Construction and visualization tools** - SNOW, POINET, BIANA, etc.

**PPI NETWORK IN CANCER:**

Protein interaction networks give insight into the molecular mechanisms behind diseases and can aid in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer by creating a pipeline (Sanz-Pamplona et al., 2012). This study uses human protein-protein interaction networks to identify target genes by establishing sub-networks for respective cancer types (Amala & Emerson, 2019).
