The code is designed for Biomarker Discovery using DGE by TCGA Biolinks and ML using R. 
The code is designed for cross-sample analysis. 
The dataset used here is from the project TCGA-LGG; feel free to import your own datas or try with our datasets! 
The code uses specific optimizations for super stringent DGE analysis with a focus on Biomarker discovery; feel free to relax the thresholds for your data! 
Unsupervized ML is used to cluster the LGG expression data, and our model clusters the samples into the 3 IDH subtypes with good accuracy
The code is well tested in our operating systems and it exports the DEGs as .csv file automatically.
Kindly read the comments carefully and hold patience while running the code. 
Feel free to write to us in case of errors or querries.
