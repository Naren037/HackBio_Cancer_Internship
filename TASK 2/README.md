This code needs you to install the gplots as well as ggplots2 packages.
This code is to be used for visualizing gene expression data for multiple samples under different conditions and finding out the upregulated and downregulated genes.
We used this code to analyze expression data of 582 genes in 10 unknown glioblastoma samples.
The code generates upregulated and downregualted genes data as a dataframe as well as prints the said genes. 
The code also plots 4 different kinds of heatmaps of input dataset, which is mentioned in comments in the codes, kindly ensure to check all the plots. 

The code includes a segment to make a basic bubble plot after using your pathway enrichment data for the generated genes.
Kindly use the bubble plot codes only after inputing the enrichment data after runnning other segments of the code.

We have well tested this code in our operation systems. If it should fail, feel free to write to us.
